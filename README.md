# MrDatabase v. 0.9.5 Alpha
Databasing as easy as it gets!

## Simple Code Examples

### Create a Database

When creating an instance of MrDatabase, it will check if the path points to an existing sqlite .db file. If it does not, it will create it.

```python
from mr_database import MrDatabase

db = MrDatabase('some/path/my.db')
```

Most connecting and disconnecting actions with the database is handled by the internals of MrDatabase.

### Tables (DDL)

Creating a new table class is super easy. This class works both as schema and record factory. Simply create a class that inherits from ```Table```. Add fields as class variables. Each field must be an instance of ```Column```. VoilÃ , the table is ready!

```python
from mr_database import Column
from mr_database import Table
from mr_database import DataTypes

class City(Table):

    id = Column(DataTypes.integer, pk=True)
    postalCode = Column(DataTypes.smallint, default=9999)
    cityName = Column(DataTypes.varchar(40), default='New York')
```

With a table class in hand, creating or dropping a table in the database is as easy as shown below!

```python
db.create_table(City)
db.drop_table(City)
```

### Records (DML)
To insert, update or delete records in the database, you need record objects representing what you want to manipulate.

You can create new records objects like the ```city1``` example or you can fetch existing ones from the database using ```db.select_record``` or ```db.select_records```

```python
city1 = City()
city1.id = db.increment_id('City', 'id')
city1.postal_code = 10115
city1.city_name = 'Berlin'

cities = db.select_records(City)                                # all cities
cities = db.select_records(City, condition='postalCode > 4000') # all cities with a postal code > 4000
a_city = db.select_record(City, condition='cityName="Berlin"')  # just Berlin

db.insert_record(city1)
db.update_record(city1)
db.delete_record(city1)
```

### Batching
By default, actions like ```insert_record``` and ```update_record```, commit changes to the database one command at a time. This is very easy to work with, but can be very taxing on performance. If you need to call many consequtive sql commands you can batch commands together to dramatically improve performance.

To set it up, you use the ```database_connection``` context manager. You pass it the ```db``` object and set ```commit=True```. Whenever you call a database action, you set ```commit=False```. This way, the commit will only be performed when you are done adding commands within the scope of the ```database_connection```.
```python
from mr_database import database_connection

next_id: int = db.increment_id('Person', 'id')

with database_connection(db, commit=True):
    for person_id in range(next_id, next_id + 10000):
        new_person = person_1.clone()
        new_person.id = person_id
        new_person.firstName += f'_{person_id}'
        db.insert_record(new_person, commit=False)
```
